1. Limited Movement
The player can only either strafe or run forward, both should be allowed at the same time

2. To increase performance, when a textured is damaged only repair it every few frames, even better go through the list
of damaged frames over a period of frames similar to how the camera draws, this allows multiple things to damage a texture a 
a small number of frames without it having to repair itself for each one :) 5x more efficient
